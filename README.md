Marine aquaculture has the potential to play an important role in the global food supply as a more sustainable protein option than land-based meat production. We can map the potential for marine aquaculture globally based on multiple constraints, including ship traffic, dissolved oxygen, bottom depth. However for my interest, i will explore this using different variables

I want to determine which Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) on the West Coast of the US are best suited to developing marine aquaculture for several species of oysters. Based on previous research, we know that oysters needs the following conditions for optimal growth:
